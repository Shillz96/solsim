# Authentication Enhancement Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying the enhanced authentication system with email verification, password reset, and improved security features.

## Overview of Changes

### Database Changes
- Added `emailVerified` (Boolean) field to User model
- Added `emailVerificationToken` (String, unique) for verification links
- Added `emailVerificationExpiry` (DateTime) for token expiration
- Added `passwordResetToken` (String, unique) for password reset
- Added `passwordResetExpiry` (DateTime) for reset token expiration

### Backend Changes
1. **Email Service** (`backend/src/services/emailService.ts`)
   - Resend integration for transactional emails
   - Verification email templates
   - Password reset email templates
   - Welcome email after verification

2. **New API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/auth/verify-email/:token` - Verify email with token
   - `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` - Resend verification email
   - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Request password reset
   - `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Reset password with token

3. **Enhanced Validation**
   - Stronger password requirements enforced in backend
   - Pattern: `^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]+$`
   - Minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, and number required

### Frontend Changes
1. **Components**
   - `PasswordStrengthIndicator` - Real-time password validation UI
   - `EmailVerificationBanner` - Shows verification status and resend button
   - Updated `AuthModal` with enhanced signup flow

2. **New Pages**
   - `/verify-email` - Email verification landing page
   - `/reset-password` - Password reset page with validation

3. **Enhanced UX**
   - Live password strength indicator
   - Visual checklist for password requirements
   - Password match indicator
   - Real-time validation feedback

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration

**IMPORTANT:** Run this before deploying the new code!

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Or if you need to create the migration first (development):

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_email_verification
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add the following to your backend environment (Railway, Vercel, etc.):

```env
# Backend - Email Configuration (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_hZkv8PeH_69uuhKcafdcUxFGzVg5ejmgk
FROM_EMAIL=SolSim <noreply@solsim.fun>
FRONTEND_URL=https://solsim.fun

# Frontend - Backend API URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://lovely-nature-production.up.railway.app
```

**Note:** Update `FRONTEND_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` based on your deployment:
- Production Frontend: `https://solsim.fun`
- Production Backend: `https://lovely-nature-production.up.railway.app`
- Development Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Development Backend: `http://localhost:4000`

### 3. Resend Configuration

1. Log in to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Verify your domain (`solsim.fun`) if not already done
3. Add the provided API key to your environment variables
4. Test email sending after deployment

### 4. Deploy Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install  # Installs the new 'resend' package
npm run build
# Deploy to Railway or your hosting platform
```

### 5. Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # No new dependencies, but good practice
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel or your hosting platform
```

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, test the following flows:

### Email Signup Flow
- [ ] Sign up with a new email
- [ ] Receive verification email
- [ ] Click verification link
- [ ] Email is marked as verified
- [ ] Receive welcome email
- [ ] Login works after verification

### Password Requirements
- [ ] Password strength indicator appears
- [ ] Real-time validation shows requirements
- [ ] Weak passwords are rejected
- [ ] Strong passwords are accepted
- [ ] Password match indicator works

### Password Reset Flow
- [ ] Click "Forgot Password"
- [ ] Enter email address
- [ ] Receive password reset email
- [ ] Click reset link
- [ ] Reset password page loads
- [ ] Set new password with validation
- [ ] Login with new password works
- [ ] Old sessions are invalidated

### Email Verification Banner
- [ ] Banner shows for unverified users
- [ ] Resend button works
- [ ] Banner disappears after verification

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. **Check Resend API Key**
   ```bash
   # In Railway or your hosting dashboard
   echo $RESEND_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Verify Domain**
   - Go to Resend dashboard
   - Ensure `solsim.fun` is verified
   - Check DNS records are correct

3. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   # Backend logs should show:
   âœ… Verification email sent to user@example.com (ID: xxx)
   ```

### Migration Fails

If the migration fails because the database is not accessible locally:

1. **Deploy Schema Changes Directly**
   ```bash
   # On Railway or your hosting platform
   railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. **Or Push Schema Without Migration**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

### Token Expiration Issues

- Verification tokens expire after 24 hours
- Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- Users can request new tokens anytime via resend functionality

## Security Notes

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- Optional special characters: `@$!%*?&`

### Email Enumeration Prevention
- Password reset always returns success message
- Even for non-existent emails
- Prevents attackers from discovering valid emails

### Token Security
- Tokens are 64-character random hex strings
- Stored as unique fields in database
- Automatically cleared after use
- Time-limited expiration

### Session Management
- Password changes invalidate all sessions
- Password resets invalidate all sessions
- Users must log in again after security changes

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:

1. **Revert Code**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Rollback Migration** (if necessary)
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration-name>
   ```

3. **Remove New Fields** (last resort)
   - The new fields allow NULL/default values
   - Existing functionality continues to work
   - Email verification is optional for existing users

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics after deployment:

- Email delivery rate (Resend dashboard)
- Verification completion rate
- Password reset success rate
- Failed login attempts
- API error rates for new endpoints

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check backend logs for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test email sending manually via Resend dashboard
4. Check database for verification tokens being created

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

- [ ] Email change verification
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Social login (Google, Twitter)
- [ ] Account recovery questions
- [ ] Login history and device management
- [ ] Suspicious activity alerts
