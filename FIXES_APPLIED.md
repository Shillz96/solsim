# Critical Fixes Applied - 2025-10-12

This document summarizes the critical issues identified and resolved in the SolSim codebase.

## Summary

Fixed 5 high-priority production issues:
1. âœ… Removed mock price broadcaster sending fake SOL prices
2. âœ… Refactored portfolio service to use Decimal consistently (prevents precision loss)
3. âœ… Added comprehensive price validation to prevent $0 or stale price trades
4. âœ… Cleaned up 530+ lines of dead Helius WebSocket code
5. âœ… Implemented proper Pino logging infrastructure

---

## 1. Mock Price Broadcaster Removed âœ…

### Issue
`backend/src/plugins/ws.ts` was broadcasting **fake random SOL prices** every 2 seconds to all connected WebSocket clients.

```typescript
// OLD CODE (DANGEROUS):
setInterval(() => {
  app.broadcastPrice({
    mint: "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
    priceLamports: solToLamports(Math.random() * 200 + 100) // Random $100-300
  });
}, 2000);
```

### Fix
Removed the mock broadcaster. Real prices are now emitted only when the price service detects actual updates.

### Impact
- **Before**: Users saw random fluctuating SOL prices unrelated to market
- **After**: Only real price updates from CoinGecko/DexScreener/Jupiter APIs are shown

---

## 2. Portfolio Service Decimal Precision âœ…

### Issue
`backend/src/services/portfolioService.ts` was using `parseFloat()` for all financial calculations, causing potential precision loss:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (PRECISION LOSS):
const qty = parseFloat((position as any).qty.toString());
const valueUsd = qty * currentPrice; // Floating point arithmetic
```

### Fix
Refactored entire portfolio service to use `Decimal` consistently:

```typescript
// NEW CODE (PRECISE):
const qty = position.qty as Decimal;
const valueUsd = qty.mul(currentPrice); // Decimal arithmetic
```

### Changes Made
- Added `D()` helper function for safe Decimal creation
- All calculations now use `.mul()`, `.sub()`, `.add()`, `.div()` instead of operators
- Proper decimal precision:
  - Token quantities: 9 decimals (Solana standard)
  - Token prices: 6 decimals
  - USD values: 2 decimals
  - Percentages: 2 decimals

### Impact
- **Before**: Accumulated rounding errors in PnL calculations, especially with small-value tokens
- **After**: Mathematically precise financial calculations matching database Decimal types

---

## 3. Price Validation Added âœ…

### Issue
`backend/src/services/tradeService.ts` would accept trades even if:
- Price was $0.00 (API failures)
- Price was negative
- Price data was stale (hours old)
- SOL price was invalid

### Fix
Added comprehensive validation before trade execution:

```typescript
// Validate price is not zero or negative
if (!tick.priceUsd || tick.priceUsd <= 0) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid price for token ${mint}: $${tick.priceUsd}`);
}

// Validate price is not stale (older than 5 minutes)
const PRICE_STALENESS_THRESHOLD = 5 * 60 * 1000;
const priceAge = Date.now() - tick.timestamp;
if (priceAge > PRICE_STALENESS_THRESHOLD) {
  throw new Error(`Price data is stale for token ${mint} (${Math.floor(priceAge / 1000)}s old)`);
}

// Validate SOL price
if (currentSolPrice <= 0) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid SOL price: $${currentSolPrice}`);
}
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Users could execute trades at $0.00, breaking PnL calculations
- **After**: Trades are rejected with clear error messages if price data is invalid or stale

---

## 4. Dead Code Cleanup âœ…

### Issue
`backend/src/plugins/priceService.ts` contained **557 lines** of complex Helius WebSocket code that was never used:
- WebSocket connection logic
- DEX swap event parsing
- Log message interpretation
- Reconnection handling

But line 556-557 showed:
```typescript
import priceServiceV2 from "./priceService-v2.js";
export default priceServiceV2; // The real implementation
```

So all 555 lines above were **dead code**.

### Fix
Replaced with a minimal re-export and architecture documentation:

```typescript
// priceService.ts (now 26 lines instead of 557)
import priceServiceV2 from "./priceService-v2.js";
export default priceServiceV2;

/*
 * ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
 * Uses polling approach (CoinGecko/DexScreener/Jupiter every 30-60s)
 * Previous Helius WebSocket implementation was removed due to complexity
 * Future enhancement: Implement logsSubscribe for real-time swap monitoring
 */
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Confusing codebase with 530+ lines of unused WebSocket logic
- **After**: Clear architecture with actual implementation in priceService-v2.ts
- Reduced maintenance burden and confusion for future developers

## 5. Proper Logging Infrastructure âœ…

### Issue
- 219 `console.log/error/warn` statements across 24 files
- No log levels (can't filter noise in production)
- No structured logging (hard to parse/search)
- Pino was configured in Fastify but not used

### Fix
Created centralized logging utility:

```typescript
// backend/src/utils/logger.ts
import pino from 'pino';

const logger = pino({
  transport: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? undefined  // JSON logs in production
    : { target: 'pino-pretty' }, // Pretty console in dev
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info'
});

export const loggers = {
  priceService: logger.child({ component: 'price-service' }),
  websocket: logger.child({ component: 'websocket' }),
  trade: logger.child({ component: 'trade' }),
  // ... etc
};
```

Migrated priceService-v2.ts to use structured logging:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
console.log(`ðŸ“ˆ SOL price updated: $${this.solPriceUsd} (was $${oldPrice})`);

// AFTER:
logger.info({ oldPrice, newPrice: this.solPriceUsd }, "SOL price updated");
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Log spam, no filtering, hard to debug production
- **After**: Structured logs with levels, component tagging, production-ready

## Additional Recommendations

### Still To Address (Medium/Low Priority)

1. **Type Safety**: Remove `(position as any)` casts - fix Prisma type imports
2. **WebSocket Authentication**: Implement token validation for WS connections
3. **Environment Validation**: Add startup checks for required env vars
4. **Debug Routes**: Secure or remove `/api/debug/*` endpoints in production
5. **Redis Error Visibility**: Add logging for Redis connection failures
6. **Continue Logging Migration**: Migrate remaining 200+ console.log statements to Pino

### Files Modified

- âœ… `backend/src/plugins/ws.ts` - Removed mock broadcaster
- âœ… `backend/src/services/portfolioService.ts` - Decimal refactor
- âœ… `backend/src/services/tradeService.ts` - Price validation
- âœ… `backend/src/plugins/priceService.ts` - Dead code cleanup
- âœ… `backend/src/plugins/priceService-v2.ts` - Logging migration
- âœ… `backend/src/utils/logger.ts` - NEW: Logging utility

### Build Status

âœ… Backend builds successfully with all changes
```bash
$ npm run build
âœ” Generated Prisma Client
âœ” TypeScript compilation successful
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Price Validation**: Try to execute trades and verify:
   - Trades are rejected if price is $0
   - Trades are rejected if price is > 5 minutes old
   - Error messages are clear and helpful

2. **Decimal Precision**: Verify portfolio totals match sum of positions exactly

3. **WebSocket Prices**: Connect to `/ws/prices` and verify:
   - No more random SOL price fluctuations
   - Prices update every 30-60 seconds from real APIs
   - SOL price matches CoinGecko

4. **Logging**: Check logs in development:
   - Structured JSON in production
   - Pretty formatted in dev
   - Appropriate log levels (debug/info/warn/error)

---

## Architecture Clarification

The current price service architecture is now clearly documented:

**Current Implementation** (priceService-v2.ts):
- Polls CoinGecko for SOL price every 30s
- Polls DexScreener/Jupiter for token prices every 60s
- EventEmitter broadcasts to WebSocket subscribers
- Redis caching (optional, fails gracefully)

**Not Implemented** (removed dead code):
- Helius WebSocket real-time swap monitoring
- logsSubscribe for DEX program events
- On-chain transaction parsing

This is intentional - the polling approach provides sufficient price freshness for paper trading while being more reliable and easier to debug than WebSocket-based solutions.
