# Deploy PumpPortal Worker to Railway

This guide explains how to deploy the Token Discovery Worker to Railway as a separate service. This worker populates live trade data from PumpPortal into Redis, which powers the market data panels on /room pages.

## What This Worker Does

The Token Discovery Worker:
- âœ… Connects to PumpPortal WebSocket for **live trades from ALL platforms**
- âœ… Subscribes to top 200 active tokens automatically
- âœ… Stores real-time trades in Redis (`market:trades:*`)
- âœ… Calculates trader P&L stats in Redis (`market:traders:*`)
- âœ… Enriches token data with health metrics
- âœ… Manages token state transitions (bonded â†’ graduating â†’ new)

## Prerequisites

- Railway account with backend service already deployed
- Backend database and Redis URLs

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Log in to Railway** at https://railway.app

2. **Go to your project** (1UP SOL / VirtualSol)

3. **Click "New Service"** â†’ **"Empty Service"**

4. **Configure the service**:
   - **Service Name**: `virtualsol-discovery-worker`
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Start Command**: `npm run railway:discovery`

5. **Add Environment Variables** (copy from main backend service):
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=<same as backend>
   REDIS_URL=<same as backend>
   HELIUS_RPC_URL=<same as backend>
   HELIUS_WS=<same as backend>
   HELIUS_API=<same as backend>
   SOLANA_RPC_URL=<same as backend>
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

   Optional (for enhanced PumpPortal features):
   ```
   PUMPPORTAL_API_KEY=<your key if you have one>
   ```

6. **Connect to GitHub**:
   - Link the same repository as your backend
   - Branch: `main` (or your production branch)
   - Railway will auto-deploy on push

7. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Worker will build and start automatically

### Option 2: Deploy via Railway CLI

```bash
cd backend

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your existing project
railway link

# Create new service
railway service create virtualsol-discovery-worker

# Set environment variables (copy from main backend)
railway variables set DATABASE_URL="<value>"
railway variables set REDIS_URL="<value>"
railway variables set HELIUS_RPC_URL="<value>"
railway variables set HELIUS_WS="<value>"
# ... add all other variables

# Deploy
railway up
```

## Verify Deployment

### 1. Check Logs

```bash
railway logs -s virtualsol-discovery-worker
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Token Discovery Worker Starting...
âœ… Database connected
âœ… Redis connected
âœ… Price service client started
ðŸ“¡ Starting streaming services...
âœ… PumpPortal stream service started
âœ… Raydium stream service started
ðŸ”Œ Registering event handlers...
âœ… Event handlers registered

ðŸŽ® Token Discovery Worker is running!
   - Listening to PumpPortal (bonded, migration)
   - Listening to Raydium (new pools)
   - Market data updates: every 30 seconds
   - Token trade subscriptions: every 5 minutes
```

### 2. Verify Redis Data

Connect to Redis and check for trade data:

```bash
# Check for trade keys (should have data within 5 minutes)
redis-cli KEYS "market:trades:*"

# Check trader stats keys
redis-cli KEYS "market:traders:*"

# View trades for a specific token
redis-cli ZREVRANGE "market:trades:<TOKEN_MINT>" 0 10 WITHSCORES
```

### 3. Test Frontend

Visit any `/room/[token]` page on https://oneupsol.fun

You should now see:
- âœ… **Recent Trades** panel populated with live PumpPortal trades
- âœ… **Top Traders** panel showing 24h trader P&L
- âœ… Real market activity from ALL platforms (not just your site)

## Worker Configuration

The worker automatically:
- Subscribes to top 200 most active tokens (by volume/market cap)
- Re-evaluates subscriptions every 5 minutes
- Stores last 50 trades per token in Redis
- Caches trader stats for 24 hours

You can monitor subscription count in logs:
```
[TokenDiscovery] Subscribing to trades for 156 active tokens
[TokenDiscovery] Total subscribed tokens: 156
```

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Not Starting

**Check logs for errors**:
```bash
railway logs -s virtualsol-discovery-worker
```

**Common issues**:
- Missing environment variables â†’ Add all required vars
- Database connection failed â†’ Verify `DATABASE_URL`
- Redis connection failed â†’ Verify `REDIS_URL`
- Helius endpoints not configured â†’ Add `HELIUS_RPC_URL` and `HELIUS_WS`

### No Trades Appearing

**Verify PumpPortal connection in logs**:
```
[PumpPortal] WebSocket connected successfully
[PumpPortal] Subscribing to events...
```

**Check if tokens are being subscribed**:
```
[TokenDiscovery] Subscribing to trades for X active tokens
```

**Verify Redis has data**:
```bash
redis-cli KEYS "market:trades:*" | wc -l
# Should return > 0 after 5-10 minutes
```

### Holder Data Not Showing

Holders panel currently shows "coming soon" - requires additional implementation:
- Use Helius `getTokenAccounts` API
- Calculate holder distribution
- Cache results in Redis

This is optional and can be implemented later.

## Cost Considerations

**Railway Pricing**:
- Worker uses ~200-500 MB RAM
- Minimal CPU usage (mostly idle, event-driven)
- Estimated cost: ~$2-5/month on Hobby plan
- Can run on same plan as backend (shared resources)

**API Rate Limits**:
- PumpPortal WebSocket: Free tier available
- Helius RPC: Depends on your plan
- DexScreener API: Free tier sufficient
- Jupiter API: Free

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

1. **Worker Uptime**: Check Railway dashboard
2. **Redis Keys**: Should grow to 100+ tokens within 1 hour
3. **Trade Volume**: Monitor log frequency of swap events
4. **Frontend**: Market data panels should populate

### Performance Metrics

Expected within 30 minutes of deployment:
- 50-200 tokens subscribed
- 500+ trades cached in Redis
- 100+ traders in stats cache
- Market data panels fully functional

## Next Steps

After deploying the worker:

1. âœ… **Test /room pages** - Verify market data panels work
2. âœ… **Monitor logs** - Check for errors or issues
3. âœ… **Scale if needed** - Increase subscriptions or resources
4. ðŸ”„ **Optional**: Implement holder distribution feature
5. ðŸ”„ **Optional**: Add more DEX integrations (Orca, Meteora, etc.)
