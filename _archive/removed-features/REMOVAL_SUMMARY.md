- Easy to restore features if needed in the future

## Next Steps

3. Consider updating user onboarding to reflect simplified feature set
4. Monitor user feedback on the simplified interface

## Rollback Plan

If real trading features need to be restored:

2. Copy removed components back from `_archive/removed-features/`
3. Restore navigation elements
4. Test functionality
