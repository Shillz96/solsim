- [x] Corrected texture filename typo (`papertexturre` â†’ `papertexture`)

### Phase 4: Performance Optimizations
- [x] Reduced texture opacity from 45% to 25%
- [x] Removed second texture overlay (`body::after`)
- [x] Eliminated expensive transforms and blur effects
- [x] Fixed z-index layering (0 for texture, 1 for content)
- [x] Changed `transition: all` to specific properties

### Phase 5: Accessibility Improvements
- [x] Removed global min-height/min-width from interactive elements
- [x] Created `.touch-target` utility class
- [x] Added high-contrast focus indicators
- [x] Verified WCAG 2.1 compliance for focus styles

### Phase 6: Typography Polish
- [x] Reduced text-stroke from 2px to 1px
- [x] Lightened text shadows for better legibility
- [x] Reduced letter-spacing from 1-2px to 0.5px
- [x] Applied to `.mario-title`, `.mario-header-text`, `.mario-font`

### Phase 7: Button Refinement
- [x] Removed glow effects (rgba shadows) from `.btn-buy`
- [x] Removed glow effects (rgba shadows) from `.btn-sell`
- [x] Standardized hover motion (translateY + shadow change)
- [x] Standardized active motion (translateY + shadow change)
- [x] Applied consistent transition timing
- [x] Reduced letter-spacing to 0.5px

### Phase 8: Component Recipes & Documentation
- [x] Created `MarioPanel` component (`components/ui/mario-panel.tsx`)
- [x] Added TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Included JSDoc examples
- [x] Created `MARIO_STYLING_GUIDE.md` with house rules
- [x] Created `STYLING_UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md` with complete changelog

## ðŸŽ¯ Verification Steps

### Visual Checks
- [ ] Visit trading page - verify button styles
- [ ] Test card hover states (small, default, large)
- [ ] Check badge appearance in different contexts
- [ ] Verify texture opacity reduction
- [ ] Test typography legibility at various sizes

### Interaction Checks
- [ ] Keyboard navigate through interactive elements
- [ ] Verify focus indicators appear correctly
- [ ] Test button hover/active states feel responsive
- [ ] Check touch targets on mobile devices

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools â†’ Performance
- [ ] Record interaction session
- [ ] Verify no excessive repaints from textures
- [ ] Check animation frame rates stay above 60fps
- [ ] Use Paint Flashing to verify texture optimization

### Code Checks
- [x] No CSS errors in `globals.css`
- [x] `@theme` warnings in `theme.css` are expected (Tailwind v4)
- [x] All token references use canonical names
- [x] No duplicate class definitions remain

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Recommended)

### Short Term
1. Test changes across different browsers
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Update any existing components using old patterns
4. Share `MARIO_STYLING_GUIDE.md` with team

### Long Term
1. Audit existing pages for duplicate card/badge usage
2. Migrate legacy components to use `MarioPanel`
3. Create additional component recipes (forms, dialogs, etc.)
4. Consider extracting to design system package
