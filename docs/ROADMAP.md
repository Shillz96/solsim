🚀 1UP SOL Roadmap

“From Paper Trades to Real Rewards — The 1UP Era Begins”

🗓️ 2–3 Week Launch Plan
Week 1 — The Switch Flips 🔴

The game goes live. The trades get real.
We’re moving from paper trading to actual Solana DEX trades — powered by Jupiter Aggregator.
Every trade you make now earns 1UP Points, and every XP you’ve built so far will matter for the airdrop snapshot.

What’s Happening:

🔄 Jupiter Integration: Real swaps with SOL — trade live tokens directly from your wallet

💰 Dual Mode: Switch between “Paper” and “Real” trading anytime

⚙️ Safety First: Built-in slippage protection, scam token filters, and price impact warnings

🧠 XP Merge: Real trading gives 2× XP to reward early testers

Your Action:
Start trading now — every trade counts toward your airdrop score.

Week 2 — The Airdrop Hunt Begins 💎

You’ve earned your XP — now it’s time to get rewarded.
We’ll take an airdrop snapshot of every active trader on the platform.
The more you trade, the more you earn. Simple.

How It Works:

Metric	What It Tracks	How It Pays
📈 Volume Bonus	Every $1 traded	+1 token per $100 volume
💸 Profit Bonus	Win rate & profitability	Up to +20% multiplier
⏳ Early Adopter	Days active since launch	+50 tokens/day
🏆 Rank Bonus	Top 100 leaderboard spots	2×–10× multipliers
👥 Referral Bonus	Invite friends who trade	+10% of their total

Example:
A user trading $500/day for a week with a solid win rate could earn 5,000–10,000 1UP tokens in the first drop.

Airdrop Dashboard:

Bonus missions (“Trade 3 trending tokens today for +10%”)

Week 3 — The 1UP Drop & Expansion 🪙

It’s finally here — the first-ever 1UP airdrop lands.

What’s Launching:

🎁 Airdrop Distribution: Claim tokens directly in-app (Phantom/Solflare supported)

📊 Airdrop Leaderboard: View the biggest earners, whales, and daily grinders

🔥 Trading Rewards Pool: Ongoing rebates for real trading volume (50% of platform fees go back to traders)

💬 Social Proof Feed: Live feed of top trades, badges, and “Level Ups”

The Drop Timeline:

Date	Event
🗓️ Week 1: Trading goes live — all activity tracked	
🗓️ End of Week 1: First snapshot for airdrop eligibility	
🗓️ Mid Week 2: Airdrop dashboard opens (see est. tokens)	
🗓️ End of Week 2: Snapshot #2 + final eligibility check	
🗓️ Week 3: 1UP Airdrop #1 distribution begins 🚀	

Goal: Reward the earliest, most active traders before public release.

🥇 Beyond Week 3 — The Power-Up Era

Once the first drop hits, the game levels up again:

💫 Seasons: Monthly leaderboard resets with prize pools

🎮 NFT Badges: Earnable, tradable, and flex-worthy

🔁 1UP Token Utility: Use tokens for fee rebates, boosts, or Mystery Boxes
