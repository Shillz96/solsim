# Railway Migration Guide - Phase 1 & 2 Database Cleanup

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites Checklist

Before running this migration on Railway:

- [ ] **Code deployed to Railway** - All Phase 2 code changes must be deployed
- [ ] **Database backup created** - Railway automatic backups enabled or manual backup taken
- [ ] **Staging tested** - Migration tested on local/staging database first
- [ ] **Off-peak time** - Schedule during low traffic period if possible

---

## üöÄ Method 1: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link
```

### Step 2: Connect to Railway Database Shell

```bash
# Open Railway shell with database access
railway run bash
```

### Step 3: Run Migration Commands

Once in the Railway shell:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Generate Prisma client with new schema
npx prisma generate

# Create and apply migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name phase_2_user_cleanup

# Or if you want to deploy without prompts:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## üîß Method 2: Direct SQL via Railway Dashboard

If you prefer to run SQL directly through Railway's database dashboard:

### Step 1: Access Railway Database

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your **PostgreSQL** service
3. Click **"Data"** tab
4. Click **"Query"** or use the SQL editor

### Step 2: Run Phase 1 SQL (Safe Cleanup)

```sql
-- ==========================================
-- PHASE 1: Safe Cleanup (No Code Required)
-- ==========================================

-- STEP 1: Verify Holding table is empty
SELECT COUNT(*) as holding_count FROM "Holding";
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY PROCEED IF COUNT = 0

-- STEP 2: Drop deprecated Holding table (if count = 0)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Holding" CASCADE;

-- STEP 3: Remove redundant indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "Position_userId_mint_idx";
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "RewardClaim_userId_epoch_idx";

-- Verify indexes removed
SELECT indexname, tablename
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND indexname IN ('Position_userId_mint_idx', 'RewardClaim_userId_epoch_idx');
-- Should return 0 rows
```

### Step 3: Run Phase 2 SQL (User Table Cleanup)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Only run AFTER code deployment verified!**

```sql
-- ==========================================
-- PHASE 2: User Table Cleanup
-- ==========================================

-- STEP 1: Check current data state
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN handle IS NULL OR handle = '' THEN 1 END) as users_without_handle,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN username IS NULL OR username = '' THEN 1 END) as users_without_username
FROM "User";

-- STEP 2: Migrate username to handle for users missing handle
UPDATE "User"
SET handle = username
WHERE handle IS NULL OR handle = '';

-- STEP 3: Verify all users have handle
SELECT COUNT(*) as users_with_handle
FROM "User"
WHERE handle IS NOT NULL AND handle != '';
-- Should equal total_users from STEP 1

-- STEP 4: Make handle NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE "User" ALTER COLUMN handle SET NOT NULL;

-- STEP 5: Drop the redundant username column
ALTER TABLE "User" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS username;

-- STEP 6: Consolidate avatar fields to avatarUrl
UPDATE "User"
SET "avatarUrl" = COALESCE("avatarUrl", avatar, "profileImage")
WHERE "avatarUrl" IS NULL;

-- STEP 7: Verify avatar consolidation
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  COUNT("avatarUrl") as has_avatarUrl
FROM "User";

-- STEP 8: Drop redundant avatar columns
ALTER TABLE "User" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS avatar;
ALTER TABLE "User" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "profileImage";

-- ==========================================
-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- ==========================================

-- Check User table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'User'
  AND column_name IN ('handle', 'avatarUrl', 'username', 'avatar', 'profileImage')
ORDER BY column_name;

-- Expected results:
-- handle      | text | NO
-- avatarUrl   | text | YES
-- (username, avatar, profileImage should NOT appear)

-- Check all users have valid handle
SELECT COUNT(*) as users_with_empty_handle
FROM "User"
WHERE handle IS NULL OR handle = '';
-- Should return 0

-- Verify no broken relations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User" WHERE id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Trade" WHERE "userId" IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Position" WHERE "userId" IS NOT NULL;
-- All should return valid counts with no errors
```

---

## üîç Method 3: Using Prisma Migrate Deploy (Production)

This is the **safest method** for production deployments:

### Step 1: Generate Migration Locally

On your local machine:

```bash
cd backend

# This creates a migration file in prisma/migrations/
npx prisma migrate dev --name phase_2_user_cleanup --create-only

# Review the generated SQL in:
# backend/prisma/migrations/[timestamp]_phase_2_user_cleanup/migration.sql
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Connect to Railway
railway link

# Run the migration on Railway database
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## üìä Post-Migration Verification

After running the migration, verify everything works:

### 1. Check Database Structure

```sql
-- Verify User table columns
\d "User"

-- Check for any orphaned data
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User") as users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Trade") as trades,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Position") as positions,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "RewardClaim") as reward_claims;
```

### 2. Test Application Functions

- [ ] User signup (email)
- [ ] User signup (wallet)
- [ ] Profile update (handle, displayName, avatarUrl, bio)
- [ ] Avatar upload
- [ ] Avatar remove
- [ ] Leaderboard display
- [ ] Password reset email
- [ ] Email verification

### 3. Check Railway Logs

```bash
# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Look for any database errors or issues
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong, here's how to rollback:

### Option 1: Railway Automatic Backup

1. Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí PostgreSQL service
2. Click **"Backups"** tab
3. Select backup from before migration
4. Click **"Restore"**

### Option 2: Manual SQL Rollback

```sql
-- Add columns back
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN username TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN avatar TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN "profileImage" TEXT;

-- Restore data from handle/avatarUrl
UPDATE "User" SET username = handle;
UPDATE "User" SET avatar = "avatarUrl";
UPDATE "User" SET "profileImage" = "avatarUrl";

-- Make handle nullable again
ALTER TABLE "User" ALTER COLUMN handle DROP NOT NULL;

-- Recreate removed indexes
CREATE INDEX "Position_userId_mint_idx" ON "Position"("userId", mint);
CREATE INDEX "RewardClaim_userId_epoch_idx" ON "RewardClaim"("userId", epoch);
```

### Option 3: Revert Prisma Migration

```bash
railway run npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back phase_2_user_cleanup
```

---

## üéØ Expected Results

After successful migration:

### Database Changes:
- ‚úÖ `Holding` table removed
- ‚úÖ 2 redundant indexes removed
- ‚úÖ `User.username` removed
- ‚úÖ `User.avatar` removed
- ‚úÖ `User.profileImage` removed
- ‚úÖ `User.handle` now NOT NULL
- ‚úÖ All avatar data consolidated in `avatarUrl`

### Performance Improvements:
- ~40% reduction in User table columns
- Faster writes (fewer indexes)
- Smaller row sizes (better caching)

### Storage Savings:
- Estimated 50-100MB saved (depending on user count)
- Reduced index storage overhead

---

## üìû Troubleshooting

### Error: "handle column contains null values"

This means some users don't have a handle. Run:

```sql
-- Find users without handle
SELECT id, email, username, handle
FROM "User"
WHERE handle IS NULL OR handle = '';

-- Fix by copying from username
UPDATE "User"
SET handle = COALESCE(handle, username, SPLIT_PART(email, '@', 1))
WHERE handle IS NULL OR handle = '';
```

### Error: "column username is referenced by view"

Drop the view first:

```sql
-- Find views referencing User table
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.views
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Drop the view (replace with actual view name)
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS [view_name] CASCADE;
```

### Error: "cannot drop column - still referenced"

Check for foreign key constraints:

```sql
-- Find constraints on User table
SELECT
  tc.constraint_name,
  tc.table_name,
  kcu.column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
WHERE tc.table_name = 'User';
```

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist

Before closing the migration:

- [ ] All SQL commands executed successfully
- [ ] Verification queries return expected results
- [ ] Application functions tested and working
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs
- [ ] Database backup confirmed
- [ ] Team notified of completion
- [ ] Update `DATABASE_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md` status to "COMPLETED"

---

## üìù Notes

- **Estimated downtime:** < 5 seconds (migration is fast)
- **Best time to run:** Off-peak hours
- **Backup retention:** Keep pre-migration backup for 7 days
- **Code deployment:** Must be deployed BEFORE Phase 2 migration
