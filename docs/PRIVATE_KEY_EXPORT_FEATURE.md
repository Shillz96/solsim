# Private Key Export Feature

## üîê Overview

Users can now export their deposit wallet private keys for self-custody. This gives users complete control over their deposited funds and allows them to import their wallet into other applications like Phantom, Solflare, or CLI tools.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Critical Security Features
1. **Multiple Confirmation Steps**: Users must check 3 security acknowledgments
2. **Blurred Display**: Private key is blurred by default
3. **Audit Logging**: All exports are logged in backend logs
4. **Warning Messages**: Clear warnings about security implications
5. **Balance Display**: Shows current balance before export

### What Users Must Acknowledge
- Anyone with the private key can access and control their funds
- They take full responsibility for securely storing the key
- They will never share it with anyone (including support)

## üéØ How It Works

### Backend Implementation

**File**: `backend/src/routes/wallet.ts`

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/wallet/export-private-key/:userId`

**Process**:
1. Verify user exists and has deposit address
2. Require explicit `confirmExport: true` in request body
3. Generate keypair deterministically from `PLATFORM_SEED` + `userId`
4. Return private key in two formats:
   - **JSON Array**: `[123, 45, 67, ...]` (64 bytes)
   - **Base64**: Encoded string format
5. Log export attempt for security audit

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "depositAddress": "7xKXt...",
  "privateKey": [123, 45, 67, ...],  // 64-byte array
  "privateKeyBase58": "base64string",
  "balance": "1.5",
  "warning": "SECURITY WARNING...",
  "exportedAt": "2025-01-23T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Frontend Implementation

**Files**:
- `frontend/components/modals/export-private-key-modal.tsx` - Main modal
- `frontend/components/navigation/wallet-balance-display.tsx` - Access point
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` - API function

**Access Point**:
Navigate to: **Top Navbar ‚Üí Click Balance ‚Üí "Export Private Key"** (only visible if you have deposited balance)

**User Flow**:
1. Click "Export Private Key" in balance dropdown
2. See security warnings modal
3. Check all 3 confirmation boxes
4. Click "I Understand - Export Key"
5. Private key is generated (blurred by default)
6. Click "Click to Reveal" to see key
7. Copy to clipboard or download as JSON file

## üîë Private Key Formats

### JSON Array Format (Recommended)
```json
[123, 45, 67, 89, ..., 255]
```
- **Length**: 64 bytes (secret key)
- **Use**: Import directly to Phantom, Solflare, solana-keygen
- **Format**: Standard Solana keypair format

### Base64 Format
```
YWJjZGVmZ2hpams...
```
- **Use**: Alternative encoding
- **Convert to Array**: `Buffer.from(base64String, 'base64')`

## üì± Importing to Wallets

### Phantom Wallet
1. Settings ‚Üí Add / Connect Wallet
2. Import Private Key
3. Paste the JSON array
4. Name your wallet

### Solflare Wallet
1. Import Wallet
2. Private Key
3. Paste the JSON array
4. Set password

### solana-keygen CLI
```bash
# Save to file
echo '[123,45,67,...]' > keypair.json

# Use with CLI
solana-keygen pubkey keypair.json
solana balance keypair.json

# Or import
solana-keygen recover 'prompt:' -o my-wallet.json
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Never share** your private key with anyone
2. **Store offline**: Write on paper, hardware wallet, or encrypted password manager
3. **Make backups**: Multiple secure locations
4. **Test small amounts** first when importing
5. **Verify address** matches before importing

### For Platform
1. **Audit logging**: All exports logged with timestamp and user ID
2. **No storage**: Private keys never stored in database
3. **Deterministic generation**: Reproduced from seed when needed
4. **Rate limiting**: Consider adding rate limits to prevent abuse
5. **2FA option**: Consider requiring 2FA for export (future enhancement)

## üîÑ Technical Details

### Key Derivation
```typescript
// Deterministic derivation
const userHash = crypto
  .createHash('sha256')
  .update(`${PLATFORM_SEED}:deposit:${userId}`)
  .digest();

const seed = userHash.slice(0, 32); // First 32 bytes
const keypair = Keypair.fromSeed(seed);
```

**Benefits**:
- Same user ID always generates same wallet
- No need to store private keys
- Platform can recreate key for withdrawals
- User can export anytime

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
PLATFORM_SEED="your-secure-random-seed-here"
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: This seed must be:
- At least 32 characters
- Randomly generated
- Kept secret and backed up securely
- Never changed (or all wallets change!)

## üìä Usage Monitoring

### Backend Logs
```
üîë Private key export requested for user abc123 (7xKXt...)
```

Look for:
- Unusual export frequency
- Exports from unknown IPs
- Multiple exports in short time

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Rate limiting**: Max 1 export per hour
2. **2FA requirement**: Require 2FA code for export
3. **Email notification**: Alert user when key is exported
4. **Export history**: Track all exports in database
5. **IP tracking**: Log IP address with exports

## üö® Emergency Response

### If Private Key is Compromised
1. **User Action**: Immediately transfer funds to new wallet
2. **Platform Action**: Mark wallet as compromised (optional feature)
3. **Investigation**: Review audit logs for suspicious activity

### If PLATFORM_SEED is Compromised
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SCENARIO**
1. All deposit wallets are compromised
2. Must immediately migrate to new seed
3. Notify all users to withdraw funds
4. Create new deposit system with new seed

## üìù Testing Checklist

- [ ] Export works for users with balance
- [ ] Export blocked for users without deposit address
- [ ] Confirmation checkboxes required
- [ ] Private key blurred by default
- [ ] Copy to clipboard works
- [ ] Download file works
- [ ] Imported key matches deposit address
- [ ] Balance transfers work with imported key
- [ ] Audit log entry created
- [ ] Multiple exports work (idempotent)

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **QR Code Display**: Show private key as QR for mobile import
2. **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Export directly to Ledger/Trezor
3. **Multi-signature Support**: Option for multi-sig wallets
4. **Key Rotation**: Allow users to rotate to new deposit address
5. **Encrypted Export**: Option to encrypt with password before download
6. **Seed Phrase Option**: Derive and show 12/24 word seed phrase
