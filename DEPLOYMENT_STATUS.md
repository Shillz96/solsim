## 🚀 Next Steps - Deploy Now!

You're now ready to deploy! Choose your preferred method:

### Method 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended) ⚡

Simply run these two scripts in order:

#### 1. Deploy Backend (5-7 minutes)
```powershell
.\deploy-backend.ps1
```

This will:
- Login to Railway
- Create PostgreSQL and Redis services
- Generate secure JWT secret
- Deploy backend
- Run database migrations
- Give you the backend URL

#### 2. Deploy Frontend (3-5 minutes)
```powershell
.\deploy-frontend.ps1
```

When prompted, enter the backend URL from step 1.

This will:
- Login to Vercel
- Configure environment variables
- Deploy frontend
- Give you the frontend URL

#### 3. Update CORS (1 minute)
```powershell
cd backend
railway variables set FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
railway up
```

**Total Time: ~10 minutes**

### Method 2: Manual Deployment 📝

Follow the step-by-step guide in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before running the deployment scripts, make sure you have:

- [ ] Your API keys ready:
  - BIRDEYE_API_KEY
  - HELIUS_API_KEY
  - COINGECKO_API_KEY (optional)
  - TWITTER credentials (optional)

- [ ] Railway account created (https://railway.app)
- [ ] Vercel account created (https://vercel.com)
- [ ] About 10 minutes of time
- [ ] Terminal/PowerShell open in project root

## 🔑 Important: API Keys

The deployment scripts will prompt you to set your API keys. If you already have them in a local `.env` file, the scripts will help you transfer them to Railway.

### Required Keys:
- **BIRDEYE_API_KEY** - For Solana market data
- **HELIUS_API_KEY** - For Solana RPC access

### Optional Keys:
- **COINGECKO_API_KEY** - Additional market data
- **TWITTER_CLIENT_ID/SECRET** - Social login

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Railway (Backend)
- **Development**: $5/month (Hobby plan)
- **Production**: ~$20-30/month
- Includes: PostgreSQL, Redis, 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU

### Vercel (Frontend)
- **Free Tier**: Good for development
- **Pro**: $20/month (for production)

### Total: $5-50/month depending on usage

## 🎯 Quick Start Command

Ready to deploy right now? Run:

```powershell
# Deploy backend
.\deploy-backend.ps1

# After backend completes, deploy frontend
.\deploy-frontend.ps1
```

## 📊 After Deployment

Once deployed, you'll have:

- 🌐 **Backend API**: `https://solsim-backend.up.railway.app`
- 🎨 **Frontend App**: `https://solsim.vercel.app`
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL Database**: Managed by Railway
- 🔴 **Redis Cache**: Managed by Railway

### Test Your Deployment

1. **Backend Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-backend.up.railway.app/health
   ```

2. **Frontend**: Open in browser:
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app
   ```

3. **Create Test Account**: Register and test trading

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"railway command not found"**
```powershell
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

**"vercel command not found"**
```powershell
npm install -g vercel
```

**CORS errors after deployment**
```powershell
cd backend
railway variables set FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://exact-vercel-url.vercel.app
railway up
```

**Build failures**
```powershell
# Backend
railway logs

# Frontend
vercel logs production
```

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy?

Run this command to start:

```powershell
.\deploy-backend.ps1
```

## 💡 Need Help?

1. Check `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
2. Review error messages in Railway/Vercel dashboards
3. Check logs: `railway logs` and `vercel logs`
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know deployment succeeded when:

- ✅ Backend health check returns `{"status":"healthy"}`
- ✅ Frontend loads in browser
- ✅ You can register a new account
- ✅ You can search for tokens
- ✅ Trading functionality works
- ✅ Leaderboard displays data

## 📈 Post-Deployment Tasks

After successful deployment:

1. **Enable Auto-Deploy**: Connect GitHub to Railway and Vercel
2. **Add Custom Domain**: (Optional) Configure your domain
3. **Monitor**: Check dashboards for errors and performance
4. **Backup**: Railway auto-backs up PostgreSQL daily
5. **Scale**: Upgrade plans as traffic grows
