## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Deposit Address Strategy
**Chosen:** Deterministic per-user addresses

**Rationale:**
- Simpler webhook configuration
- User-friendly (reusable address)
- Easier to track and reconcile
- Already implemented in codebase pattern

### 2. Wallet Balance Fetching
**Chosen:** Direct blockchain queries in TradingModeContext

**Rationale:**
- Real-time accuracy
- No backend caching lag
- Follows existing connection pattern
- Lower backend load

### 3. Webhook Architecture
**Chosen:** Single endpoint filtering by address

**Rationale:**
- Scalable (Helius webhook limits)
- Simpler infrastructure
- Database-driven address validation
- Easy to monitor and debug

### 4. Withdrawal Security
**Chosen:** Immediate execution with validation

**Rationale:**
- Web3 UX standard
- Simpler implementation
- User already authenticated
- Can add 2FA/email confirmation later

### 5. Implementation Priority
**Chosen:** DEPOSITED balance first, then WALLET

**Rationale:**
- DEPOSITED partially implemented
- Lower complexity (no signing)
- Can test deposit/withdraw independently
- Wallet flow builds on DEPOSITED patterns

## Database Schema

### New Models

**Deposit:**
```prisma
model Deposit {
  id                String    @id @default(uuid())
  userId            String
  amount            Decimal
  txSignature       String    @unique
  status            String    @default("PENDING")
  depositAddress    String
  fromAddress       String?
  confirmedAt       DateTime?
  createdAt         DateTime  @default(now())
  user              User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  
  @@index([userId, createdAt])
  @@index([status, createdAt])
  @@index([txSignature])
}
```

**Withdrawal:**
```prisma
model Withdrawal {
  id                String    @id @default(uuid())
  userId            String
  amount            Decimal
  fee               Decimal   @default(0)
  netAmount         Decimal
  toAddress         String
  txSignature       String?   @unique
  status            String    @default("PENDING")
  errorMessage      String?
  requestedAt       DateTime  @default(now())
  processedAt       DateTime?
  confirmedAt       DateTime?
  user              User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  
  @@index([userId, requestedAt])
  @@index([status, requestedAt])
  @@index([txSignature])
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures

1. **Environment Variables**
   - PLATFORM_SEED stored securely in Railway
   - Webhook secrets for signature verification
   - Never exposed in logs or responses

2. **Transaction Verification**
   - All deposits verified on-chain before crediting
   - Duplicate transaction prevention via unique txSignature
   - Amount validation (minimum thresholds)

3. **Withdrawal Validation**
   - Address format validation
   - Amount limits (min/max)
   - Sufficient balance checks
   - Atomic database transactions

4. **Webhook Security**
   - Signature verification with HELIUS_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   - Timing-safe comparison
   - Rate limiting via existing middleware

5. **Wallet Trading Security**
   - User signs transactions client-side
   - Platform never has access to private keys
   - Transaction verification before recording
   - Proper error handling for rejected signatures

### Recommended Additional Security

1. Email confirmation for large withdrawals (>1 SOL)
2. Daily withdrawal limits per user
3. 2FA requirement for withdrawals
4. Platform wallet monitoring and alerts
5. Separate hot/cold wallet architecture
6. Withdrawal approval queue for large amounts
