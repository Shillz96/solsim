# 🎉 Code Successfully Pushed to GitHub!

Your SolSim code is now at: **https://github.com/Shillz96/solsim**

## ✅ What's Been Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All code committed
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub (main branch)
- ✅ Railway & Vercel CLI tools installed
- ✅ Deployment configuration ready

## 🚀 Next Steps - Deploy with GitHub Integration

Now you can deploy using GitHub integration for automatic deployments on every push!

### Method 1: Deploy with GitHub Auto-Deploy (Recommended)

This connects your GitHub repo so every push automatically deploys.

#### A. Railway Backend Deployment

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   ```
   https://railway.app/dashboard
   ```

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose `Shillz96/solsim`
   - Select `backend` directory as root

3. **Add Services**
   - Click "New Service" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Click "New Service" → "Database" → "Redis"

4. **Configure Variables**
   - Click your backend service → "Variables" tab
   - Add these variables:

   ```
   JWT_SECRET=[generate: openssl rand -base64 48]
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=4002
   FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://solsim.fun
   DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false
   DEXSCREENER_BASE_URL=https://api.dexscreener.com/latest
   BIRDEYE_API_KEY=your-key
   HELIUS_API_KEY=your-key
   COINGECKO_API_KEY=your-key
   ```

5. **Set Root Directory**
   - Settings → "Root Directory" → Set to `backend`
   - Settings → "Build Command" → `npm install && npm run build`
   - Settings → "Start Command" → `npm run db:migrate:prod && npm start`

6. **Deploy**
   - Railway will auto-deploy
   - Get your URL from Settings → Domains

#### B. Vercel Frontend Deployment

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   ```
   https://vercel.com/dashboard
   ```

2. **Import Project**
   - Click "Add New" → "Project"
   - Import `Shillz96/solsim` from GitHub
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `frontend`

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   
   Add these during import or in Settings → Environment Variables:
   
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://solsim.fun
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=production
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your frontend

5. **Update Backend CORS**
   - Go back to Railway → Your Backend → Variables
   - Update `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` to your actual Vercel URL
   - Redeploy backend

### Method 2: CLI Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer CLI:

#### Railway CLI with GitHub

```powershell
cd backend

# Link to Railway project
railway link

# Or create new project from GitHub
railway init

# Deploy
railway up

# Set variables in dashboard (Railway v4 requirement)
# Then redeploy
railway up
```

#### Vercel CLI with GitHub

```powershell
cd frontend

# Link to Vercel (will detect GitHub repo)
vercel

# Follow prompts to link to GitHub

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

After connecting to GitHub:

### Backend (Railway)
- ✅ Every push to `main` → Auto-deploys backend
- ✅ Can configure different branches in Railway settings
- ✅ View deployment logs in Railway dashboard

### Frontend (Vercel)
- ✅ Every push to `main` → Auto-deploys to production
- ✅ Every PR → Creates preview deployment
- ✅ View deployments in Vercel dashboard

## 📊 Generate JWT Secret

You'll need this for Railway variables:

```powershell
# PowerShell
$bytes = New-Object byte[] 48
[System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create().GetBytes($bytes)
[Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes)
```

Or if you have Git Bash/WSL:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48
```

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

After both deploy:

1. **Backend Health Check**
   ```powershell
   curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

2. **Frontend**
   - Open: `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app`
   - Should load the SolSim landing page

3. **Test Connection**
   - Register a new account
   - Search for a token
   - Execute a test trade

## 📝 Important Notes

### Railway Settings
- **Root Directory**: Must be set to `backend`
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run db:migrate:prod && npm start`
- **Environment**: Add all variables via dashboard

### Vercel Settings
- **Root Directory**: Must be set to `frontend`
- **Framework**: Next.js (auto-detected)
- **Environment Variables**: Add via dashboard

### Database Setup
After Railway deploys:
```powershell
railway run npm run db:seed
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Railway not building?
- Check Root Directory is set to `backend`
- Verify `railway.json` exists in backend folder
- Check build logs in Railway dashboard

### Vercel build failing?
- Check Root Directory is set to `frontend`
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard

### CORS errors?
- Ensure `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` in Railway matches your Vercel URL exactly
- No trailing slash
- Use `https://` not `http://`
