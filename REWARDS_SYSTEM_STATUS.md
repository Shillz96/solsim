# üéÅ Rewards System Status & Setup Guide

## üÜï Latest Update - New Reward Scale (1 Point = 1,000 vSOL)

**What Changed:**
- Rewards now use a points-based system with 1 point = 1,000 vSOL tokens
- This makes rewards much more substantial and attractive!

**New Calculation:**
- 1 trade = 1 point = **1,000 vSOL** (was 1 vSOL)
- $100 volume = 2 points = **2,000 vSOL** (was 2 vSOL)
- 10% win rate = 10 points = **10,000 vSOL** (was 10 vSOL)
- Maximum per claim: 200 points = **200,000 vSOL** (was 200 vSOL)

**Example:** A trader with 10 trades, $5,000 volume, and 65% win rate now earns **170,000 vSOL** instead of 170 vSOL!

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

### Critical Fix - Tokens Now Send Automatically!
**Before:** Claims were created as "PENDING" but tokens were never sent  
**After:** When you click "Claim Rewards Now", tokens are immediately sent to your wallet on-chain

## üîß Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components:
1. **Frontend UI** - Claim button visible in Portfolio page
2. **Cooldown System** - 5-minute cooldown between claims  
3. **Token Transfer** - Auto sends tokens on-chain when claiming
4. **Reward Calculation** - Based on trades, volume, win rate
5. **No Barriers** - Anyone with trading activity can claim rewards

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Configuration:
1. **VSOL_TOKEN_MINT** environment variable
2. **REWARDS_WALLET_SECRET** environment variable  
3. **Wallet must have vSOL tokens** to distribute

## üìã How The System Works Now

### Claiming Flow:
1. User goes to Portfolio page
2. Connects Solana wallet
3. Clicks "Claim Rewards Now" button
4. Backend calculates rewards using point system:
   - **1 point per trade** (= 1,000 vSOL)
   - **2 points per $100 volume** (= 2,000 vSOL)
   - **10 points per 10% win rate** (= 10,000 vSOL)
   - **Max 200 points per claim** (= 200,000 vSOL)
5. Backend **immediately sends tokens** on-chain
6. User receives transaction signature
7. 5-minute cooldown starts

### Requirements to Claim:
- ‚úÖ Email verified
- ‚úÖ Wallet connected  
- ‚úÖ 5 minutes since last claim
- ‚úÖ Have some trading activity (trades, volume, or win rate)

## üöÄ Required Environment Variables

Add these to your Railway backend service:

```bash
# vSOL Token Mint Address (the token contract address)
VSOL_TOKEN_MINT=YourTokenMintAddressHere

# Rewards Wallet Secret Key (JSON array format)
REWARDS_WALLET_SECRET=[1,2,3,4,5...]  # Your wallet's secret key array
```

### How to Get REWARDS_WALLET_SECRET:
```bash
# If you have a Solana wallet file
solana-keygen pubkey ~/.config/solana/id.json

# Get the secret key array
cat ~/.config/solana/id.json
# Copy the entire array: [1,2,3,4,...]
```

## üí∞ Fund the Rewards Wallet

The rewards wallet needs to have vSOL tokens to distribute. With the new scale (1 point = 1,000 vSOL):

1. Get your rewards wallet address from Railway logs (it prints on startup)
2. Send vSOL tokens to that wallet
3. Recommended minimum: 1,000,000 vSOL (enough for ~5 max claims of 200,000 each)
4. Test with smaller amounts first

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### 1. Check Configuration
```bash
# SSH into Railway or check logs
echo $VSOL_TOKEN_MINT
echo $REWARDS_WALLET_SECRET
```

### 2. Verify Rewards Wallet Balance
- Copy rewards wallet address from logs
- Check balance on Solscan: `https://solscan.io/account/[wallet-address]`
- Ensure it has vSOL tokens

### 3. Test Claiming
- [ ] Go to Portfolio page
- [ ] Connect wallet
- [ ] Make sure you have at least 0.01 vSOL in your wallet
- [ ] Click "Claim Rewards Now"
- [ ] Should see success message with transaction signature
- [ ] Check your wallet for received vSOL tokens
- [ ] Try claiming again - should see 5-minute cooldown

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Reward system not configured" Error
**Problem:** Missing environment variables  
**Solution:** Add VSOL_TOKEN_MINT and REWARDS_WALLET_SECRET to Railway

### "Token holder verification failed" Error
**Problem:** Wallet doesn't have 0.01+ vSOL  
**Solution:** Buy/transfer vSOL tokens to your wallet first

### "No rewards available" Error  
**Problem:** No trading activity yet  
**Solution:** Make some trades to earn rewards

### "Reward claim failed" Error
**Problem:** Rewards wallet is empty or transaction failed  
**Solution:** 
1. Check rewards wallet has vSOL tokens
2. Check RPC connection is working
3. Check Railway logs for detailed error

### Claims Stay "PENDING"
**Problem:** Old issue before this fix  
**Solution:** Fixed! New claims send immediately. Old PENDING claims need manual processing.

## üìä Monitoring

### Check System Health:
```bash
# Railway logs should show:
‚úÖ VSOL Token Mint configured: [address]
‚úÖ Rewards Wallet configured: [address]

# On claim, should show:
‚úÖ Reward claimed: X VSOL to [wallet] ([tx-sig])
```

### Monitor Claims:
- Check database `RewardClaim` table
- Status should be "COMPLETED" with txSig
- claimedAt should be set

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Admin dashboard to view all claims
- [ ] Automatic top-up alerts for rewards wallet
- [ ] Bulk processing of failed claims
- [ ] Referral rewards system
- [ ] Premium tier with reduced cooldown
- [ ] Weekly/monthly leaderboard rewards

## üìû Support

If rewards aren't working:
1. Check Railway backend logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Confirm rewards wallet has funds
4. Test with small amounts first
5. Check Solana network status

## üéØ Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ **WORKING** (after this fix)

The rewards system is now functional and will:
- Calculate rewards based on trading activity
- Immediately send tokens on-chain when claimed
- Enforce 5-minute cooldown
- Verify token holders
- Show clear error messages

**Next Step:** Set environment variables and fund the rewards wallet!
