## 6. Narrative
Sarah is a college student interested in cryptocurrency but afraid to risk her limited savings. She discovers SolSim through a Twitter post and signs up with her email, immediately receiving 10 virtual SOL to start trading. After successfully growing her virtual portfolio to 25 SOL over two weeks, she converts 5 SOL to 0.5 $SIM tokens, experiencing her first real crypto earnings. Motivated by this success, she purchases more $SIM tokens to unlock the premium tier, gaining access to 100 virtual SOL and advanced features.
